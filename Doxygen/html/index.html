    <h3>The Game</h3>
    <p>MSP Mario Kart is a terminal based game, meant to mimic the Nintendo game, Mario Kart. The player uses his/her keyboard to maneuver a vehicle left and right. The track is drawn, and the user must stay on the track. The longer the play stays on track, the quicker the car accelerates. If the user goes off track, the car reaches its minimum speed, and then must accelerate back to its top speed. Going off track is defined by the car intersecting with any of the '-' lines running horizontal. Once the player is off track, the terminal will illuminate red. The player must travel a certain distance before he/she completes the race. Once the race is complete, the player's score is given to him/her based off of his/her time. The lower the time, the better the player did.</p>

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>The goals for this project were as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Familarize myself with programming in C</li>
        <li>Build a Mario Kart type game in a terminal</li>
        <li>Use a potentiometer and ADC to build a controller for the game</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>The game is set up in a very simple manner. A random number generator is used to determine a random x position for the left etent of the track. This value is then stored in an array. As the driver progresses through the track, the positions of the left extent of the track are shifted down to provide the idea that the track is moving In order to draw the track itself, dashes, "-" are used to represent the wall, and blank spaces, " ", are used to represent the track itself. The wall is plotted from the left extent on the window the left extent of the track. A specified track width is then plotted. Finally, The remainder of the track, from the end of the track width to the right extent of the terminal, is plotted with walls. </p>
    
    <p>The x position of the player is tracked throughtout the game. As the player moves his or her position, it is checked to make sure that it does intersect the track walls. If it does, it sets the players speed to the slowest setting. As the player goes on without intersecting the wall, his or her speed increases. This is done by measuring the time since the player collided with the wall.</p>
    
    <p>In order for the player to complete the race, he or she must travel a certain distance. This distance is measured by the number of times the track has been updated. In order to keep the score, the time at completion is subtraced from the time at start in order to provide a score.</p>
    
    <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
    <p>Although it seemed easy to implement at the time, utilzing an array to store value and plot points was found to be vastly inefficient. In the future, I plan to redo the backend mechanics of the game. Although I am not certain on the way to do so yet one way of improving the game woud be to clear only the portions of the terminal that I need to, rather than clearing the entire terminal. Clearning the entire terminal proved to be extremely cumbersome and resulted in significant lag within the gameplay.</p>
    
    <p>Another area where I can improve is building a controller for the game. Although this was a strech goal, it was something that was within my capability, I simply lacked the time to be able to do so. I plan on revissiting this project over the summer to make improvements as well as design and build a controller. Future revisions could include item boxes and multiplayer modes. </p>
